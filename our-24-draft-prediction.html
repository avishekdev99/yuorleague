                                Change is constant in the world of hockey. Just days after the Panthers claimed the Stanley
                                Cup in an epic seven-game series against the Oilers, the league and its fans are already
                                gearing up for the 2024 NHL Draft on Friday night. Each year, this event symbolizes hope for
                                all 32 teams in the league's future. While some teams may swing and miss, others could
                                discover a hidden gem that propels their franchise to greater heights.

                                This year's draft promises to be unusually unpredictable, with experts largely agreeing only
                                on Macklin Celebrini going first overall. The rest of the draft remains a mystery, but what's
                                draft season without a mock draft? Check out ours below.

                                solidified his status as the top prospect this year with an outstanding freshman season at
                                Boston University. He racked up 64 points in 38 games, becoming the youngest player to
                                win the Hobey Baker Award. Celebrini joins forces with 2023's 4th overall pick, Will Smith, in
                                San Jose's quest to rejuvenate their Western Conference standings.

                                Chicago Blackhawks Chicago's second overall pick immediately spices up
                                the draft. Despite their roster needs everywhere, they opt for Demidov, a talented Russian
                                winger who could potentially partner with Connor Bedard in the near future. While Demidov
                                still has a year left on his contract with St. Petersburg, Chicago is in no hurry to rush him if it
                                means securing the most talented player available.

                                selecting Artyom Levshunov from Michigan State. This 18-year-old defenseman promises
                                years of excellence for Anaheim, showcasing reliability across the ice. With a burgeoning
                                roster of young talent, Levshunov's addition bolsters the Ducks' lineup. In his debut NCAA
                                season, he scored 9 goals and assisted 26 times in 38 games for the Spartans.

                                to miss half of the previous season. Nonetheless, his impressive 27 goals in 32 games
                                before injury make him a worthwhile risk for teams like Columbus.

                                rostered defensemen and none signed for next season), Silayev offers hope for a promising

                                our mock draft, Zeev Buium lands seventh overall to the Senators. The Denver University
                                standout became only the third defenseman in the past two decades to score fifty points in
                                his freshman season, showcasing both offensive prowess and defensive prowess. Buium fits
                                perfectly with Ottawa's young and dynamic roster.

                                stacked roster, New Jersey can afford to patiently develop this American sniper. Eiserman's
                                potential to refine his game and thrive among skilled linemates sets the stage for potential

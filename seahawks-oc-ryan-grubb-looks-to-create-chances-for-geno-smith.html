                            The only direction for new Seahawks offensive coordinator Ryan Grubb is up, given Seattle's
                            struggles in offensive stats last season.

                            In 2023, the Seahawks ranked No. 21 in total yards (323 per game) and No. 28 in rushing
                            yards (93 per game). They were last in time of possession and No. 23 in red-zone
                            conversion percentage. Their 21.4 points per game, ranking 17th in the league, was the
                            lowest-scoring offense in the Pete Carroll era, which began in 2011.

                            Grubb's task this offseason is to create a more consistent and explosive offense, leveraging
                            the talent of Pro Bowl receivers DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett, last year's first-round pick
                            Jaxon Smith-Njigba, and dynamic running backs Kenneth Walker III and Zach Charbonnet.

                            "We're trying to meld together some of the things we've done in the past, whether a long
                            time ago or recently," Grubb said. "We want to be a physical, dominant team with an
                            explosive, confusing element that people are used to."
                        </p>

                            After winning the Associated Press Comeback Player of the Year and earning a Pro Bowl
                            nod in 2022, Geno Smith's production dipped last season. He completed 64.7% of his
                            passes for 3,624 yards, with 20 touchdowns and nine interceptions. Injuries along the
                            offensive line contributed to his inconsistent play, with the Seahawks using nine different
                            offensive line combinations last season. Key tackles Charles Cross and Abe Lucas missed
                            significant time due to injuries.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This season, the Seahawks expect to have three new starters on the interior offensive line:
                            free agent addition Laken Tomlinson at left guard, second-year pro Olu Oluwatimi at center,
                            and a competition at right guard among third-round pick Christian Haynes, incumbent
                            Anthony Bradford, and prospect McClendon Curtis.
                        </p>

                    <div class="detail-wrap">
                        <p>
                            Grubb's challenge is to reignite the running game and create opportunities for Smith to
                            quickly distribute the ball and execute deep passes. The Seahawks had just six passing
                            plays of 40-plus yards last season, ranking 25th in the NFL.
                        </p>

                            Grubb, who previously led the Washington Huskies to the national title game with one of
                            college football's most explosive offenses, aims to bring similar success to Seattle. Last
                            season, Huskies quarterback Michael Penix Jr. led college football with 1,787 deep passing
                            yards, as reported by Pro Football Focus.

                        <p>
                            Smith is eager to integrate these passing concepts into Seattle's offense. "I feel like I'm a
                            drop-back passer, and this is a drop-back offense," Smith said. "An offense that's going to
                            spread the ball around and trust the quarterbacks to make the right decisions."
                        </p>

                    <div class="detail-wrap">
                        <p>
                            Under Grubb, the Seahawks are likely to use more pre-snap shifts and motions to create
mismatches. Last season, the Seahawks used pre-snap shifts or motions 48.6% of the time,
ranking 21st in the league. In contrast, the Dolphins led the league with 80.3%, followed by
the 49ers (79.2%) and the Rams (71.9%).

                    <div class="detail-wrap">
                        <p>
                            Grubb also intends to involve running backs more in the passing game. Last season,
Seattle's backs had 68 receptions for 494 receiving yards and one touchdown, placing them
among the bottom third in the league. "We want to make every guy on the field as dangerous
as possible from any position," Grubb said.

                                Smith anticipates more offensive production in his third season as the team's starter. "There
are going to be great things coming for us," Smith said. "Coach Grubb is doing a great job
being demanding and ensuring guys are studying and on point, but also giving them some
grace. It's a new system, and there will be mistakes. We can learn from them. Our job is to
make the plays come alive and make it all look good."

                        Alistair Johnston had an outstanding season with Celtic and is currently enjoying a
                        productive summer with his national team. The right-back played a crucial role in Canada’s
                        performance at the Copa America, helping them secure a 0-0 draw against Chile, which
                        advanced them to the tournament's quarter-finals.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="detail-wrap">
                    <p>
                        Johnston, a proud Canadian, consistently gives his all for the national team, a dedication
                        that hasn’t gone unnoticed. He is a beloved figure among his teammates and supporters,
                        known for his combative style that translates well to international football.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="detail-wrap">
                    <p>
                        Former Canada manager and current Toronto FC boss John Herdman highlighted
                        Johnston's esteemed reputation in his homeland. Herdman remarked:
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="detail-wrap">
                    <p>
                        “We always felt he was made for British football. Those who worked with him, including my
                        defensive coach Jason de Vos, sensed he was a hard-nosed, high-intensity defender. He
                        loves a tackle and enjoys getting forward to deliver crosses.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="detail-wrap">
                    <p>
                        “He’s a proper Scottish football type. I’ve never seen Ali have a bad game for Canada.
                        Certainly not in my time. He consistently performed at an eight out of 10 or higher. His
                        mindset and character are built on solid habits.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="detail-wrap">
                    <p>
                        “The only time he’s been out of sorts was in the Nations League Final when he was carrying
                        an injury from Celtic. He probably returned too early to try and help us win. He said, ‘I’m
                        sorry, gaffer,’ but I told him he should never be sorry because his effort is always there. Even
                        then, he was still a seven out of 10.”
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="detail-wrap">
                    <p>
                        Despite having only made 62 appearances for Celtic, Johnston has already won five
                        trophies, making a significant impact on the team's right flank. Initially brought in by Ange
                        Postecoglou, he remains an important member of the squad under Brendan Rodgers.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="detail-wrap">
                    <p>
                        Celtic is not expected to recruit a new right-back this summer, ensuring Johnston will
                        continue to be the first choice next season. Returning to Scotland full of confidence after his
                        Copa America exploits would be fantastic for the team. An extended stay in the tournament
                        following the upcoming quarter-final on Friday night would further solidify his reputation as
                        one of Canada’s finest and most consistent performers.

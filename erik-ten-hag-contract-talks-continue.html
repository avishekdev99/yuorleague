                        Manchester United are in advanced talks with Erik ten Hag regarding a contract extension,
                        marking a positive step forward for the Dutchman's future at Old Trafford. Sky Sports News

                        initially reported that the club's priority was securing new terms with Ten Hag before finalizing
                        any changes to the coaching staff.

                        Discussions about potential additions to Ten Hag's coaching team, including former United
                        striker Ruud van Nistelrooy and current Go Ahead Eagles head coach Rene Hake, are
                        reportedly progressing well.

                        Despite Manchester United finishing in eighth place in the 2023/24 Premier League season,
                        their worst performance in the league's history, Ten Hag managed to guide them to victory in
                        the FA Cup, defeating rivals Manchester City. This triumph marked his second major trophy
                        in as many years at the helm.

                    <p>
                        The club opted to retain Ten Hag amidst speculation linking several prominent managers,
                        such as Mauricio Pochettino, Thomas Tuchel, and Gareth Southgate, with the managerial
                        position. Ten Hag himself learned of the decision while on holiday with his family, as
                        revealed during a recent interview on Dutch television.

                    <p>
                        Despite a challenging season marred by injuries to key players, Ten Hag steered United to
                        Europa League qualification with their FA Cup triumph at Wembley Stadium.

                    <p>
                        Following a comprehensive post-season review, which acknowledged Ten Hag's resilience
                        and achievements, Manchester United are keen to provide him with the opportunity to
                        showcase his managerial abilities within the newly implemented sporting structure under
                        INEOS's ownership.

                        Meanwhile, negotiations are ongoing with striker Joshua Zirkzee's representatives, with
                        cautious optimism surrounding a potential deal. Competition for Zirkzee's signature includes
                        interest from Arsenal, AC Milan, and Juventus. Discussions with Paris Saint-Germain
                        regarding central midfielder Manuel Ugarte are also progressing, although United have set a
                        valuation and are exploring alternative options should negotiations stall.

                        The future of Casemiro, who has attracted interest from clubs in Europe and Saudi Arabia,
                        remains another factor influencing United's plans in the midfield transfer market. In defense,
                        United continue to monitor several targets, including Jarrad Branthwaite from Everton, as
                        well as Leny Yoro from Lille and Marc Guehi from Crystal Palace.

                                    The Dallas Mavericks, fresh off their first NBA Finals appearance since 2011, have been
                                    aggressively active in free agency, aiming to bolster their roster for another championship
                                    run. After falling short against the Boston Celtics, the Mavericks signed forward Naji
                                    Marshall, traded Tim Hardaway Jr. to the Pistons for young guard Quentin Grimes, and
                                    reportedly acquired four-time champion Klay Thompson in a multi-team sign-and-trade deal
                                    with the Golden State Warriors.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                                <p>
                                    Assuming the Thompson deal goes through, the Mavericks' projected starting lineup for next
                                    season will be:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        Luka Doncic
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Kyrie Irving
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Klay Thompson
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        PJ Washington
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Dereck Lively II
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </div>
                            <div class="detail-wrap">
                                <p>
                                    On paper, this lineup boasts significant talent. Doncic and Irving have already proven they
                                    can coexist and lead a team to the Finals. Lively’s impressive rookie season earns him a
                                    starting spot, and Washington showed his prowess on both ends during the postseason.
                                    Adding Thompson’s caliber to the mix makes this lineup formidable most nights.
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="detail-wrap">
                                <p>
                                    However, free agency has its downsides. The Mavericks lost Derrick Jones Jr., their best
                                    defender last season, to the Clippers, and traded Josh Green in the Thompson deal. While
                                    Green's departure isn't a significant loss, swapping Jones and Green for Marshall and
                                    Thompson doesn’t seem like the major upgrade it should be.
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="detail-wrap">
                                <p>
                                    This critique isn't about Thompson's abilities but rather the issues he doesn’t solve for the
                                    Mavericks. Against the Celtics, the Mavericks struggled defensively against multiple
                                    perimeter threats. Even with Washington and Jones, they lacked a strong point-of-attack
                                    defender to disrupt Boston's perimeter actions. Thompson, post-injuries, isn’t the elite
                                    defender he once was. While still good, he isn’t great, and with weaker defenders like Doncic
                                    and Irving, the Mavericks need Thompson to perform closer to his prime defensive
                                    years—an unrealistic expectation.
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="detail-wrap">
                                <p>
                                    Offensively, Thompson is a clear upgrade, especially as a shooter. Despite a down year, he
                                    still shot 38.7% from deep on nine attempts per game, which would have ranked second on
                                    the Mavericks. However, adjusting to Dallas’s heliocentric offense, which relies on Doncic
                                    and Irving, may be challenging for Thompson, who is used to Golden State’s ball-movement
                                    system.
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="detail-wrap">
                                <p>
                                    Thompson’s role in Dallas will likely see him as a catch-and-shoot player, waiting in the
                                    corners for passes from Doncic and Irving. While effective, this is a departure from his
                                    previous role. He was convinced by the Mavericks' pitch, so there may be adjustments or
                                    compromises in their offensive system. The Mavericks have used off-ball screens effectively
                                    before, and Thompson could thrive in that role.
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="detail-wrap">
                                <p>
                                    Beyond being a 3-point shooter, Thompson can score off the dribble, addressing a
                                    Mavericks' need from their Finals clash with the Celtics, where Irving and Doncic carried too
                                    much of the offensive load. However, expanding this part of his game will be an adjustment.
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="detail-wrap">
                                <p>
                                    The primary concern remains the Mavericks’ defense. Thompson, despite his offensive
                                    prowess, doesn’t solve their defensive weaknesses. Unless another trade is in the works,
                                    Dallas will heavily rely on Thompson’s defense—a significant gamble. Retaining Jones Jr.
                                    and acquiring Marshall might have been a safer bet. However, the Mavericks have taken
                                    risks before, such as trading for Irving, that paid off. Given they gave up little to get
                                    Thompson and received some second-round picks, this might be a risk worth taking.
